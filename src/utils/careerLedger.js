// Player career ledger — club-only player biography that knows where stats
// were earned across leagues and cups, without polluting the canonical
// competition record books.
//
// Distinct from the per-tier / per-cup competition stores:
//   - allTimeLeagueStatsByTier / allTimeCupStatsByCup are competition records
//     ("all-time Div 8 top scorers", "all-time Clubman Cup top scorers").
//   - playerCareers is the player's own career across the club:
//     ("Remy Diaby scored 10 goals in Div 8, 14 in Div 7, 3 in Clubman Cup").
//
// archivePlayerSeason consumes canonical per-competition season blobs to
// build the per-tier / per-cup breakdown. Apps and motm split per-competition
// is not supported (canonical doesn't track them) so those stay aggregate
// only on the broad season totals.
//
// Pure: returns a new playerCareers object; never mutates input.
